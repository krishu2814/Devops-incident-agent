## Phase Checklist

| Phase | Description | Status | Key Deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Basic Node.js + TypeScript Backend | Completed | Express server, `GET /health`, `POST /incidents` |
| **Phase 2** | Simulated Infrastructure | Completed | Mock data, `getServiceHealth`, `getServiceMetrics`, `getServiceLogs`, `getRecentDeployments`, `/services` routes |
| **Phase 3** | LangChain Tools | Completed | `@langchain/core` + `zod` tools (`get_service_health`, `get_service_metrics`, `search_logs`, `get_recent_deployments`) |
| **Phase 4** | Basic LangGraph Agent | Completed | `@langchain/langgraph` installed, `IncidentAnnotation`, `IncidentState`, `START -> agent -> tool -> agent -> END`, wired to `POST /incidents` |
| **Phase 5** | Investigation Agent | Completed | Multi-step agent dynamically selecting diagnostic tools (health, metrics, logs, deployments) with deduplication & circuit breaker |
| **Phase 6** | Root Cause Analysis (RCA) | Upcoming | RCA node outputting probable cause, confidence score, and supporting evidence |
| **Phase 7** | Remediation Plan | Upcoming | Remediation node proposing actions (`rollback`, `restart`, `scale`, `do_nothing`) |
| **Phase 8** | Human-in-the-Loop | Upcoming | Pause graph at approval node; `/approve` and `/reject` endpoints |
| **Phase 9** | Execute Remediation | Upcoming | Mutate simulated infrastructure state upon human approval |
| **Phase 10** | Verification | Upcoming | Re-check metrics/health post-remediation; halt if not recovered |
| **Phase 11** | Redis | Upcoming | Caching tool results and storing transient agent state |
| **Phase 12** | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Upcoming | Relational persistence for incidents, audit trails, and decisions |
| **Phase 13** | Background Jobs (BullMQ + Worker) | Upcoming | Asynchronous investigation queue decoupled from HTTP request |
| **Phase 14** | Streaming / Status (SSE) | Upcoming | Server-Sent Events for real-time investigation steps |
| **Phase 15** | Error Handling | Upcoming | Robust try/catch, LLM fallback, graceful degradation |
| **Phase 16** | Testing (Jest) | Upcoming | Unit tests for tools, integration tests for graph nodes and APIs |
| **Phase 17** | Docker | Upcoming | `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (API, worker, Postgres, Redis) |
| **Phase 18** | README & Final Polish | Upcoming | Portfolio-ready README with Mermaid architecture diagram and interview Q&A |

## Detailed Execution Plan for Phase 6 (Next)
1. **RCA State Fields:** Add `rootCause`, `confidence` (number 0-1), `confidenceLevel` (`confirmed` | `probable` | `uncertain`), and `evidence` (`string[]`) to `IncidentState`.
2. **Root Cause Analysis Node:** Create `src/agents/rootCause.ts` that synthesizes findings from metrics, logs, and deployments to establish causality.
3. **Graph Transition:** Connect `investigator` (when complete) -> `rootCauseNode` -> `END`.
4. **Validation:** Verify RCA generation for broken services (`payment-service`) and healthy services (`order-service`).
